The University of Hawaii at Manoa boasts a diverse and active student body, deeply engaged in a wide range of clubs and organizations. These groups play a crucial role in fostering academic, cultural, and social development on campus.

**"UHnify"** emerges as a strategic solution to this challenge. Developed with a focus on user-centric design, UHnify streamlines the organization and participation processes for both students and club administrators.
